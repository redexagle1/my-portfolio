## game developement
- pygame 
honestly I am not surprised at all I mean python has a massive library index that have multiple usage from data analysis to web development and so on
the projects you are going to witness focus on building games in pyhton dev
1. a simple racing game
this is my first project that I have learned and developed not gonna lie if it's based on this playlist 
![https://youtu.be/V_B5ZCli-rA?feature=shared&t=28]
but this experience gave me the following:
- a solid understanding of how can you develop a 2D pixel game which of course involved 
    - how can you control the movement of your charcter 
    - how can you make collusion between objects in your environment
    - how can you make a path-following bot
- that all the year that I have spent in learning about trigonometry isn't useless this honstly gave me the feel of megalomania although my knowledge at the time of development wasn't that huge
